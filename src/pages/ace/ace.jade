			[Checkout ACE on github](https://github.com/atomic-component-engine/ace) - Ace is a system for creating mini 
			bootstraps for every project. It's a system for creating and maintinaing atomically designed websites.

			I created ACE with [@itsravanous](https://github.com/itsravenous) after introducing him to atomic design we both 
			immediately began using that methodology with our SASS, however we soon realised that we could also combine our
			Grunt, Jade workflow with that methodology.

			Using Yeoman we began to create a node based command line tool now known as ACE, its still in development but 
			is actively used by both of us on live projects. ACE consists of:

			* Yeoman generators
			* grunt file
			* base boilerplate including require.js
			* automated component js execution
