			h3 Everton Free School Project

			:markdown
				Everton Free School is an alternative provision school, run by Everton Football Club, 
				that provides a special educational environment for vulnerable young people aged 14-19. 
				Right from inception, we stood alongside Everton in strategising and implementing the use of 
				technology for staff and students.
				
				With the curriculum of the school very vocation-specific and directed at the abilities 
				and interests of the young people, there was a heavy focus on mobility. Having this 
				requirement at the forefront of our partnership, we’ve helped Everton Free School and 
				their partners deploy iPad and Mac devices with enterprise-level control throughout the 
				school, to be used in classes, for homework and for managing students. As the school 
				increases in size, we’ll also be distributing iTunes U across all the devices as a 
				virtual learning environment for staff and students to stay engaged and excited to learn.
